<h1> What is Planetside 2? </h1>
<p> PlanetSide 2 is a revolutionary massive scale first-person shooter where soldiers battle as one in strategic, targeted missions against enemy empires in an all-out planetary war. <br><br>
The game challenges the skill and grit of the most seasoned soldier through intense infantry, air, and ground vehicle gameplay.<br><br>
Battles take place not between dozens of troops, but thousands; with air and ground vehicles slugging it out alongside squads of troops.<br>
Whether in open fields, tightly packed urban centers, or enormous structures, planning, teamwork and communication are essential. 
<br>PlanetSide 2 features incredible continent maps with dozens of square kilometers of seamless gameplay space; every inch of which is hand-crafted, contestable space. 
<br>With the territorial control meta-game, landmass has intrinsic value.
