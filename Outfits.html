<p> Outfits are the "guilds" or "clans" of Planetside 2 and play a very important role in each and every battle. <br><br>
Outfits can range from a small group of friends, to medium sized group that specializes in specific roles such as infantry, air, or rapid response teams, to huge gaming communities that can field multiple platoons of hundreds of players. <br><br>
While the motto often holds true: "Size. Always. Matters.", playing with even a small outfit can be an incredibly rewarding experience. <br>
Always remember: the whole is always greater than the sum of its parts!
